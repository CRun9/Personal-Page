        <p>Cyber Security Specialist</p>
        <p>
          I am an up and coming Cyber Security professional with several
          internship experiences. I also have several projects related to cyber
          security analysis and AI. My involvement in the community includes
          participating in Cyber Defense Competitions and CTFs.

        <h3>Forensics Case</h3>
        <p>
          My personal case study that I developed highlights the concepts of an
          insider threat using a host machine, network, and stegonography. This
          was a solo project where I developed the scenario and executed an
          investigation using digital forensics techniques that I learned in the
          course. I recovered deleted files using non-volatile memory data
          recovery techniques, the registry, and the Autopsy program. Captured
          non-volatile data that pointed to malicious connections and collected
          network traffic related to those connections using wire shark. I also
          used stegonography programs to recover messages from images. At the
          end of the project, I created a walk through report of the scenario
          that can be followed by an expert. I learned how to apply my skill set
          appropriately and how an insider threat could be fatal to a company.
